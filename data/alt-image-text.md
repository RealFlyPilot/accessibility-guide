### Images with text should be accessible to screen readers

Images that contain text in them such as logos should make that text available to screen readers in some form. You should have an appropriate element in the HTML that contains the text, then place the image through the CSS `background-image` attribute. There are many methods to hide the text, buy typically you can use a combination of `color: transparent`, `overflow: hidden`, and `user-select: none`.
